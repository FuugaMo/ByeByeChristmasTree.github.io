                Last winter, I came to London and experienced my first Christmas. That was the first time I had a
                real Christmas tree at my home. As a tree lover, I was extremely excited. I made posters to invite
                friends over to make hanging decorations and have hot beverages. I felt like I was living in a
                cartoon. But very unfortunately，I got covid from that party. After a month, when I finally could walk
                outside the house, there were abandoned Christmas trees in the streets. I was surprised and
                heartbroken. I had never known about the post-Christmas thing. How come no one has ever mentioned
                this before?
            </p1>
            <p1>
                When I saw photos of abandoned trees posted on social media I realised there are others who feel sad
                about them too. Maybe a cemetery would be helpful to make us, and maybe these trees, feel better?

                The project includes a website, a performance, and a song. I have written the song, clumsily
                performed my musical debut, and intend to document the making of this project in the style of a
                music video in the future.
